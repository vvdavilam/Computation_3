   - Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository using the cd command.
   - Run the following command to clone the repository:

      `git clone https://github.com/vvdavilam/Computation_3.git`

3. ### Navigate to the Cloned Repository:
   - Change to the directory of the cloned repository:
       `cd Computation_3 `
   
4. ### Create and Activate Virtual Environment:
   - Create a new virtual environment (replace `your_environment_name` with your desired name):
      `conda create --name your_environment_name python=3.8`

# How to play
### Single player:
- To move your car in the desired direction, use the arrow keys.
- You will be confronting other cars that are going in the opposite way. You must keep from running into them if you want to live.
- You can also come across power-ups in addition to cars. Getting power-ups will give you a short-term advantage (or disadvantage).

### Multiplayer: 
Take part in an exciting race where the goal is to survive longer than your opponent. Should one of the players lose, the other player wins right away.
- You will have two roads.
- Player 1: Use 'WASD' keys.
- Player 2: Use arrow keys.
- Both roads will have cars coming in the opposite direction as well as power ups that will help them have some advantage (or disadvantage) for a period of time.

# Power Ups
Use these awesome power-ups to enhance your racing experience! During the game, they cause you to gain special benefits or disadvantages.

All power-ups last 5 seconds. If you are using any power-up and grab another one, you will continue using the power-up you had. It only changes the power-up when you are not using any power-up.
