# How to play
## Singleplayer:
- To move your car in the desired direction, use the arrow keys.
- You will be confronting other cars that are going in the opposite way. You must keep from running into them if you want to live.
- You can also come across power-ups in addition to cars. Getting power-ups will give you a short-term advantage (or disadvantage).
